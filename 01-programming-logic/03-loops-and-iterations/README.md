## Exploration of Conditional Structures and Loops in JavaScript

The understanding of checking numerical relationships using conditional structures (if/else), including the use of nested conditionals in the program, was acquired.

### Implementation of the "while" Loop

The "while" loop was introduced to iterate over a code block while a specific condition holds true, allowing the program to perform repetitive actions.

### Introduction of Attempt Counter

An attempt counter was implemented to track and display the number of times the user tried to guess a secret number. This functionality can be valuable, for example, in a guessing game.
