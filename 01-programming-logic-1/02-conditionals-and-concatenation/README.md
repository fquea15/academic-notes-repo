## Console Usage and Conditional Structures in JavaScript

The console is employed to test and debug the code, displaying messages and values during program execution.

### Exploring Conditional Structures

The use of conditional structures (if/else) is learned to develop logic that enables the program to make decisions based on specific conditions.

### Custom Message for Incorrect Attempts

A code block is implemented to display a personalized message when the user's attempt does not match the secret number.

### Utilizing Template Strings

Template Strings are used to concatenate the secret number with the value stored in a variable and present a customized message.
