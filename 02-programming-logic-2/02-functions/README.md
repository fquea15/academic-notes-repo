## JavaScript Functions Overview

In this project, we developed a JavaScript function that takes 2 parameters to generate a random number. We understood how to use the structure of a function to encapsulate a reusable code block effectively. The `return` keyword was employed within the function to return the value of the generated random number. Additionally, we created another function named `exibirMensageInicial`, which doesn't have a return value or parameters. We learned about the distinction between functions with return values and those without, and how to call and invoke functions to display initial messages on the screen. Furthermore, we recognized the significance of parameters and return values for facilitating communication between functions and the rest of the program.
